# predict-climatology

Earth's climate is one of the fundamental boundary conditions on many Earth surface processes. For this reason, global climate models (GCMs) are often a critical part of Earth science research. However, they remain highly computationally expensive to run, and often access to a super-computer is needed to run a GCM in a reasonable amount of time. This motivates the question: is it possible to reasonably predict climate without an expensive GCM?

Here we investigate whether climatology can be reasonably predicted using machine learning algorithms.
